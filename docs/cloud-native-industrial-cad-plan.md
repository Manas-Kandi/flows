# Cloud-Native Industrial CAD Platform: Product Blueprint

## 1. Executive Overview
The goal is to deliver a professional-grade, cloud-native parametric CAD platform that blends the modeling depth of SolidWorks and Fusion 360 with modern collaboration, governance, and deployment practices. The product must support browser-based access and installable desktop applications with consistent functionality. Artificial intelligence augmentations are a long-term enhancer, but the immediate priority is a rock-solid modeling environment, predictable performance, and enterprise trustworthiness.

## 2. Point of View & Personas
- **Industrial Designer**: Balances aesthetics and manufacturability. Needs rapid concept iteration, configurable visualization, and a painless bridge to engineering.
- **Mechanical Engineer**: Owns tolerance, structural soundness, and downstream integration. Requires deterministic constraint solving, assembly tools, and high-fidelity documentation.
- **Design Manager / Director**: Coordinates teams, approvals, and delivery timelines. Needs branch visibility, review instrumentation, and governance controls.
- **Manufacturing Liaison**: Validates feasibility, cost, and process readiness. Relies on clean exports, change tracking, and annotations tied to specific geometry.
- **IT / Security Admin**: Ensures compliance, access policies, and integration with corporate systems. Demands deployment transparency, audit logs, and enterprise authentication.

## 3. Product Pillars
1. **Precision Modeling**: Robust parametric sketching, constraint management, assemblies, and drafting that meet the expectations of seasoned CAD professionals.
2. **Native Collaboration**: Real-time, branch-aware teamwork with inline feedback and auditable histories, eliminating file-based bottlenecks.
3. **Cloud Reliability**: Elastic compute, built-in resilience, and multi-platform clients that sync seamlessly while honoring enterprise security baselines.
4. **Manufacturing Preparedness**: End-to-end output pipeline (STEP, IGES, STL, DXF, drawings) with BOM fidelity and configurable release workflows.

## 4. End-to-End Workflow Narrative
1. **Project Initiation**: Team opens or branches a project. Permissions inherit from workspace policies; metadata templates prompt for product code, revision start, and target manufacturing methods.
2. **Concept Modeling**: Designers sketch in the `Model` workspace, using constraint-driven sketches feeding extrusions, lofts, sweeps, and fillets. Numeric palettes accept expressions and unit conversions. History timeline captures each feature.
3. **Collaboration**: Stakeholders join concurrently. Live presence (avatars, cursors) shows who is working where. Inline comments attach to faces or timeline steps. Branching supports divergent explorations without overwriting.
4. **Assembly & Fit**: Designers open the `Assembly` workspace to position components, define mates, and run interference checks. Exploded views and motion previews validate mechanisms.
5. **Documentation**: Engineers generate drawings in the `Document` workspace. Standard templates apply GD&T symbols and title blocks. Drawing packages are versioned alongside models.
6. **Review & Approval**: The `Review` workspace aggregates pending comments, checklists, and change logs. Managers run structured walkthroughs using follow mode. Decisions convert to tasks or approvals.
7. **Release & Handoff**: Once validated, assemblies move to a locked release state. Export bundles (STEP + drawings + BOM) are generated, logged, and shared with manufacturing systems through integrations or download tokens.
8. **Iteration**: Post-release updates happen via new branches. Change impact reports compare geometry and metadata, ensuring traceability.

## 5. UX & UI System
### 5.1 Experience Principles
- **Professional Clarity**: Prioritize legibility, neutral palettes, and predictable layout; avoid ornamental flourishes.
- **Context Awareness**: Surfaces, tools, and inspectors change based on selected entities to reduce hunting.
- **Muscle Memory Respect**: Stable shortcut schemes, customizable keymaps, and minimal UI movement during operations.
- **Feedback without Noise**: Subtle motion, color, and iconography indicate status without overwhelming the workspace.

### 5.2 Layout Framework
- **Top Command Bar**: Mode switcher (Model, Assemble, Document, Review, Render, Manage), quick actions, undo/redo, search/command palette.
- **Left Sidebar**: Project tree, branch selector, configuration variants, saved component library, and pinned references.
- **Central Viewport**: High-performance WebGL canvas with selectable projection views, split layouts, and sectioning tools.
- **Right Inspector**: Contextual panel with dimensions, constraints, materials, appearance, and metadata tabs.
- **Bottom Timeline**: Feature history with drag-to-edit, suppression toggles, comparison badges, and playback controls.
- **Status Strip**: Connection state, unit system, compute jobs, notifications, and measurement readouts.

### 5.3 Key Interactions
- **Sketching**: Constrained drawing with automatic inference lines, numeric inputs, snap grids, and constraint badges. Error states highlight over/under-constrained elements.
- **3D Manipulation**: Gizmos constrained to axes/planes, in-view HUD for live dimensions, configurable snapping precision.
- **Selection**: Filters by entity type, hover prehighlight, quick isolate/ghost toggles, and breadcrumb trail for nested components.
- **Measurements**: Persistent measurement palette with history, tolerance entry, and copy-to-clipboard options.
- **Command Palette**: Fuzzy search for operations, features, materials, and documentation. Remembers recent commands and user-defined macros.

### 5.4 Design System Deliverables
- Figma library with components (buttons, panels, inspectors, timeline cards, notifications) adhering to an 8px grid.
- Icon set aligned to standard CAD metaphors, designed at 16px and 24px sizes.
- Typography guidelines: sans-serif (e.g., Inter) for UI chrome, monospaced numerals in measurement and parameter fields.
- Accessibility benchmarks: WCAG AA contrast, keyboard navigability, and screen reader descriptors for hierarchy trees.

## 6. Collaboration Model
- **Concurrency Engine**: Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) or operational transforms tailored for parametric history, ensuring consistent states across clients.
- **Live Presence**: Real-time cursor trails, view synchronization, and quick “jump to collaborator” shortcuts.
- **Branching & Merging**: Git-like branching with visual diff—highlighted feature changes, parameter deltas, drawing revisions. Merge conflicts resolved via timeline-based UI.
- **Commenting**: Inline 2D/3D annotations, task assignments, resolved states, and external notification routing (email, Slack).
- **Audit Trail**: Immutable event log capturing user, timestamp, action, previous/next states, with export to CSV or SIEM tools.
- **Session Snapshots**: Time-boxed snapshots for design reviews or regulatory records, stored as read-only references.

## 7. Platform Architecture
### 7.1 Client Applications
- **Web Client**: React/TypeScript front-end with Three.js for viewport rendering, Zustand for state management, WebAssembly modules for constraint solving and tessellation.

- **Search & Metadata**: Elasticsearch for text-based search, Postgres for relational metadata (projects, branches, permissions), S3-compatible object store for binary artifacts.
- **Job Orchestration**: Kubernetes-managed workloads for heavy compute (rendering, simulation preparation), with priority queues and cancellation controls.

### 7.3 Infrastructure
- **Cloud Provider**: Multi-region deployment across AWS/Azure with edge routing (CloudFront/Azure Front Door) to minimize latency.
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes with managed node groups (including GPU nodes), autoscaling policies, and namespace isolation per environment.

- **Disaster Recovery**: Cross-region replication, automated backups, runbooks for failover, RPO ≤ 15 minutes, RTO ≤ 1 hour.

## 8. Desktop Application Strategy
- **Parity First**: Feature parity with the web client; offline mode limited to read-only inspection with queued edits once reconnected.
