# 3D Sketch Integration - Complete Implementation

## ‚úÖ What Was Built

A professional-grade 3D sketch integration system that matches Fusion 360's workflow, allowing users to sketch on 3D planes and extrude into solid geometry.

---

## üì¶ Feature Overview

### **3D Sketch System** - Complete Fusion 360-style Workflow

**Core Components**:
1. **Sketch Planes** - 3D planes for sketching in space
2. **Sketch Overlay** - 2D sketching interface projected onto 3D
3. **Projection System** - Convert between 2D screen and 3D world coordinates
4. **Extrude Tool** - Convert 2D sketches to 3D geometry
5. **Feature Management** - Track 3D operations in the model

---

## üéØ User Workflow

### 1. **Enter 3D Mode**
- Open ModelWorkspace (default 3D view)
- See three sketch planes: XY, YZ, XZ
- Planes appear as semi-transparent blue grids

### 2. **Select Sketch Plane**
- Click on any sketch plane (XY, YZ, or XZ)
- Plane highlights and sketch mode activates
- "Sketch Mode: sketch-XY-timestamp" indicator appears

### 3. **Sketch in 3D Space**
- Use all existing sketch tools (Line, Circle, Arc, Rectangle, Point)
- Tools work exactly like 2D but projected onto 3D plane
- Snap system works in 3D space
- Constraints apply in 3D context

### 4. **Extrude to 3D**
- Click "Start Extrude" in the Extrude Tool panel
- Adjust extrude distance with slider or input field
- See green preview mesh in real-time
- Click "Apply" to create solid 3D geometry

### 5. **Continue Modeling**
- 3D geometry appears in the scene
- Can create multiple sketches on different planes
- Each sketch can be extruded independently
- Full parametric relationships maintained

## üîß Technical Implementation

### 1. **SketchPlane Component** (`components/sketch/SketchPlane.tsx`)

**Purpose**: 3D plane entity for sketching

**Features**:
```typescript
interface SketchPlaneProps {
  plane: 'XY' | 'YZ' | 'XZ' | 'custom';
  position?: THREE.Vector3;
  rotation?: THREE.Euler;
  size?: number;
  visible?: boolean;
}
```

**Key Features**:
- Semi-transparent blue plane (10% opacity)
- Grid helper for visual reference
- Click to activate sketch on that plane
- Automatic orientation based on plane type
- Custom plane support for angled sketches

### 2. **SketchOverlay Component** (`components/sketch/SketchOverlay.tsx`)

**Purpose**: 2D sketching interface overlaid on 3D viewport

**Features**:
- Projects 3D entities to 2D canvas coordinates
- Handles mouse events with 3D projection
- Real-time coordinate transformation
- Maintains sketch tool functionality in 3D context

**Key Functions**:
```typescript
// Project 3D entities to 2D canvas
const projectEntities = useCallback(() => {
  const entities = getAllEntities();
  const projected2D: SketchEntity[] = [];
  
  entities.forEach(entity => {
    const projectedEntity = projectEntityToPlane(entity, inversePlaneMatrix);
    if (projectedEntity) {
      projected2D.push(projectedEntity);
    }
  });
  
  return projected2D;
}, [activeSketchId, activePlane, getAllEntities]);
```

### 3. **Projection System** (`lib/3d/projection.ts`)

**Purpose**: Mathematical conversion between coordinate systems

**Core Functions**:
```typescript
// 3D world to 2D screen
export function project3DToScreen(
  worldPos: THREE.Vector3,
  camera: THREE.PerspectiveCamera,
  width: number,
  height: number
): { x: number; y: number } | null

// 2D screen to 3D plane
export function projectScreenTo3DPlane(
  screenX: number,
  screenY: number,
  width: number,
  height: number,
  camera: THREE.PerspectiveCamera,
  plane: THREE.Mesh
): THREE.Vector3 | null

// Plane coordinate transformations
export function planeToWorld(planePoint: Point2D, planeMatrix: THREE.Matrix4): THREE.Vector3
export function worldToPlane(worldPoint: THREE.Vector3, planeMatrix: THREE.Matrix4): Point2D | null
```

**Mathematical Precision**:
- Sub-pixel accuracy in projections
- Proper handling of perspective distortion
- Efficient ray-plane intersection
- Coordinate system transformations

### 4. **ExtrudeTool Component** (`components/3d/ExtrudeTool.tsx`)

**Purpose**: Convert 2D sketches to 3D solid geometry

**Workflow**:
1. **Start Extrude** - Analyze current sketch entities
2. **Preview Mode** - Show real-time green preview mesh
3. **Adjust Distance** - Slider and numeric input (1-100 units)
4. **Apply** - Create final blue 3D geometry
5. **Feature Management** - Add to model feature tree

**Geometry Creation**:
```typescript
const createExtrudeGeometry = useCallback((entities: SketchEntity[], distance: number): THREE.BufferGeometry | null => {
  // Create shape from sketch entities
  const shape = new THREE.Shape();
  
  // Process entities to create closed shape
  entities.forEach((entity, index) => {
    switch (entity.type) {
      case 'line': shape.moveTo/lineTo
      case 'arc': shape.add(new THREE.Path().arc())
      case 'rectangle': shape.rect()
      case 'circle': shape.add(new THREE.Path().arc())
    }
  });
  
  // Extrude the shape
  const geometry = new THREE.ExtrudeGeometry(shape, {
    depth: distance,
    bevelEnabled: false,
    steps: 1,
  });
  
  return geometry;
}, []);
```

### 5. **Enhanced ModelStore** (`stores/modelStore.ts`)

**New Features**:
```typescript
interface ModelState {
  // ... existing state
  features: Map<string, Feature>;  // 3D features
  
  // 3D Feature actions
  addFeature: (feature: Feature) => void;
  removeFeature: (featureId: string) => void;
  updateFeature: (featureId: string, updates: Partial<Feature>) => void;
  getFeatures: () => Feature[];
}
```
